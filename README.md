the whole plan is in plan.md

## STEP 1
- set up django and postgresql. made a 'moviepeople_db' named database in postgres. updated settings.py with database configuration to use postgresql. ran `python manage.py migrate` to set up the database. 
- the whole `migrate` command worked so ig its set up correctly.
